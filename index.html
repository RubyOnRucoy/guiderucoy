    <p>GM Rucoy is the first developer of the game. Most of the game was programmed by him. He lives in Mexico and his name is Ricardo. He has a college degree and is very experienced. I had a conversation with him awhile back and he said the game was programmed in GoLang and some other language; I think it was Java but take that with a grain of salt. Players commonly refer to him by the following names Ric, Ricardo, Rucoy, and Creator. He has trolled the community multiple times.</p>
